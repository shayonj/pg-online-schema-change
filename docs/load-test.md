# Preliminary Load Test

## pg-osc: No downtime schema changes with 7K+ writes/s & 12k+ reads/s

This is a very basic load test performed with `pgbench` against a single instance PostgreSQL DB running on DigitialOcean with the following configuration:

- **128GB RAM**
- **32vCPU**
- **695GB Disk**
- Trasanction based connection pool with **500 pool limit**

Total time taken to run schema change: **<3mins**

## Simulating load with pgbench

**Initialize**

```
pgbench -p $PORT --initialize -s 20 -F 20 --foreign-keys --host $HOST -U $USERNAME  -d $DB
```

This creates bunch of pgbench tables. The table being used with `pg-osc` is `pgbench_accounts` which has FKs and also references by other tables with FKS, containing 2M rows.

**Begin**

```
pgbench -p $PORT -j 72 -c 288 -T 500 -r --host $DB_HOST -U $USERNAME -d $DB
```

## Running pg-osc

Simple `ALTER` statement for experimentation purposes.

```sql
ALTER TABLE pgbench_accounts ADD COLUMN "purchased" BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
```

**Execution**

```bash
bundle exec bin/pg-online-schema-change perform \
-a 'ALTER TABLE pgbench_accounts ADD COLUMN "purchased" BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;' \
-d "pool" \
-p 25061
-h "..." \
-u "..." \
--pull-batch-count 2000 \
--delta-count 200
```

## Conclusion

By tweaking `--pull-batch-count` to `2000` (replay 2k rows at once) and `--delta-count` to `200` (time to swap when remaining rows is <200), `pg-osc` was able to perform the schema change with no impact within very quick time. Depending on the database size and load on the table, you can further tune them to achieve desired impact. At some point this is going to plateau - I can imagine the replay factor not working quite well for say 100k commits/s workloads. So, YMMV.
